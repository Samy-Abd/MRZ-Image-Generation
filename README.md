# MRZ-Image-Generation
The MRZ Image Generator is a project designed to generate Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) images based on a list of names. MRZ is a standardized format used in passports, visas, and other official documents for machine-readable information. This project provides a convenient way to create MRZ images for testing, development, or educational purposes.  
This was based of the work of [Arg0s1080](https://github.com/Arg0s1080/mrz)
